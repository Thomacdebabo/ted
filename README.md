# TED - the todo buddy
The idea is to have a little cli interface which allows you to create and manage tasks fairly quickly.
- I need something that is quite fast and easy to use. 
- It should export .md files in obsidian format
- It is based on things I read in in [[Getting things done by david allen]] where you think a bit more about your todos so they include:
	- **name**: What you want to do
	- **goal**: basically what the conditions are to consider it done
	- **next step**: what the next thing you should be doing is, something that you could do
- Dataformat is a dictionary which uses titles to define key value pairs
